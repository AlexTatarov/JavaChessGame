# JavaChessGame
This is a Chess Game created as a project for my Advanced OOP class. It is intended to support 3 game modes: playes vs player on the same computer, player vs player on different computers, player vs AI. The credit for creating the UI and Networking part of the project goes to my lab partner Radut Daniel. The rest of it was done by me.
